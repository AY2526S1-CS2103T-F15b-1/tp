InsuraBook is a **desktop app for insurance agents managing clients' contacts**, optimized for use via a Command Line
Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
We assume you type really fast and prefer a CLI for speed, but still want a GUI to see your data. No prior programming
knowledge is needed, although you ought to be comfortable installing Java and running a `.jar` file from
a terminal.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.
> **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F15b-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to a folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your InsuraBook.

4. In the same folder, right-click on an empty space and select `Open in Terminal`.

5. Then type the `java -jar insurabook.jar` command in the terminal to run the application.
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.
    <p align="center">
        <img alt="img.png" height="400" src="images/homepage.png" width="500"/>
    </p>

6. Try typing the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it.
   e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `list` : Lists all clients.
    * `add -n John Doe -b 1970-01-01 -c_id C101` : Adds a client named John Doe with client id C101 and birthday on 01 Jan 1970.
    * `delete -c_id C101` : Deletes client with client id C101 from InsuraBook.
    * `view -policy` : Lists all policy types that the insurance company sells.
    * `clear` : Deletes all clients.
    * `exit` : Exits the app.

7. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**‚ÑπÔ∏è Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `add -n NAME -b BIRTHDATE -c_id CLIENT_ID`, `NAME`, `BIRTHDATE`, `CLIENT_ID` are parameters which can be used
as `add -n John Doe -b 2002-01-01 -c_id C101`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `-c_id CLIENT_ID [-desc DESC]` can be used as `-c_id C101 -desc Car Accident` or as `-c_id C101`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `-n NAME -c_id CLIENT_ID`, `-c_id CLIENT_ID -n NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will
be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines
as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Adding a client: `add`
<a href=#table-of-contents style="font-size: 0.8em; color: #aaaaaa;">(back to Contents)</a>

Adds a client to InsuraBook. Use this command when you sign a new client and need to create their initial record. This
is the first step to tracking all their contact information and policies in InsuraBook.

Format: `add -n NAME -b BIRTHDATE -c_id CLIENT_ID`

Examples:
* `add -n John Doe -b 2002-01-01 -c_id 123` adds a client name `John Doe` with birthdate `2002-01-01` and client ID
`123`.

<p align="center">
    <img alt="img.png" height="300" src="images/addClient.png" width="500"/>
</p>

* `add -n Betty Cheng -b 2000-01-01 -c_id C1` adds a client name `Betty Cheng` with client ID `C1`.

---

### Adding a policy type: `add policy type`
<a href=#table-of-contents style="font-size: 0.8em; color: #aaaaaa;">(back to Contents)</a>

Adds a new policy type to InsuraBook. Before you can assign policies to clients, define the available policy
‚Äúproducts.‚Äù Use this command to add a new "product" (eg. "BRUHealth") to your system's catalog.

Format:  
`add policy type -pt_n POLICY_TYPE_NAME -pt_id POLICY_TYPE_ID [-desc DESCRIPTION] [-pr PREMIUM]`

Examples:
* `add policy type -pt_n BRUHealth -pt_id BRH001` adds a policy type named `BRUHealth` with policy type ID `BRH001`.
To view this, use the `view -policy` command.

<p align="center">
    <img alt="img.png" height="300" src="images/addPolicyType.png" width="500"/>
</p>

* `add policy type -pt_n BRUWealth -pt_id BRW001 -desc Holistic savings plan -pr 1000` adds a policy type named `BRUWealth`
with policy type ID `BRW001`, optional description `Holistic savings plan`, and optional premium amount `1000`.

---

### Adding a policy to client: `add policy`
<a href=#table-of-contents style="font-size: 0.8em; color: #aaaaaa;">(back to Contents)</a>

Adds a policy with expiry date to a client. When a client purchases one of your products, use this command to create
that policy (with its ID and expiry date) and link it directly to their client record.

Format:
`add policy -p_id POLICY_ID -c_id CLIENT_ID -pt_id POLICY_TYPE_ID -exp EXPIRY_DATE`

Examples:
* `add policy -p_id 101 -c_id 123 -pt_id P02 -exp 2025-10-01` adds a policy with policy ID `101`, of policy type ID
`P02`, with expiry date `2025-10-01` to the client with client ID `123`.

<p align="center">
    <img alt="img.png" height="300" src="images/addPolicyToClient.png" width="500"/>
</p>

---

### Adding a claim: `add claim`
<a href=#table-of-contents style="font-size: 0.8em; color: #aaaaaa;">(back to Contents)</a>

Adds a new claim record to an existing policy for a specific client. Use this command to log claims made by clients against their
policies, including the amount and date.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
<span style="color:orange">‚ö†Ô∏è **Warnings:**</span>
Ensure that the client and policy already exist in InsuraBook before adding a claim.
</div>

Format:  
`add claim -c_id CLIENT_ID -p_id POLICY_ID -amt CLAIM_AMOUNT -date CLAIM_DATE [-desc DESCRIPTION]`

Examples:
* To add a claim with no description:
    ```
    add claim -c_id C101 -p_id P101 -amt 1000 -date 2025-10-01
    ```
    This adds a claim with amount $1000 on date 2025-10-01 to policy P101 for client C101.
* To add a claim with a description:
    ```
    add claim -c_id C101 -p_id P101 -amt 2000 -date 2025-11-01 -desc Car accident
    ```
    This adds the same claim but includes the description "Car Accident".

> üí° **Quick Tip:** Not sure of the policy ID or client ID? Use the `list` or `view -c_id CLIENT_ID` commands to find them
before adding a claim.

---

### Listing all clients: `list`
<a href=#table-of-contents style="font-size: 0.8em; color: #aaaaaa;">(back to Contents)</a>

Shows a list of all clients in the InsuraBook. This is your main "view all" command. Use it any time you need to see
a complete list of all clients currently stored in InsuraBook.

Format: `list`

<p align="center">
    <img alt="img.png" height="300" src="images/list.png" width="500"/>
</p>

---

### Editing a policy type: `edit policy type`
<a href=#table-of-contents style="font-size: 0.8em; color: #aaaaaa;">(back to Contents)</a>

Edits an existing policy type in InsuraBook, in case of any wrong input. If you need to correct the name, premium, or
description of a previously entered policy type, use `edit policy type`.

Format:
`edit policy type -pt_id POLICY_TYPE_ID [-pt_n POLICY_TYPE_NAME] [-desc DESCRIPTION] [-pr PREMIUM]`

Examples:
* `edit policy type -pt_id BRH001 -pt_n BRUHealthExtra` edits the policy type
  name to be `BRUHealthExtra` for the policy type `BRH001`.

<p align="center">
    <img alt="img.png" height="300" src="images/editPolicyType.png" width="500"/>
</p>

* `edit policy type -pt_id BRH001 -pr 1000` edits the policy type premium
  to be `1000` for the policy type `BRH001`.

---

### Editing a claim: `edit claim`
<a href=#table-of-contents style="font-size: 0.8em; color: #aaaaaa;">(back to Contents)</a>

Updates the details of an existing claim. Use this command if you need to correct the amount, date, 
or description of a previously filed claim.

> üí° **Tip:** All ID fields (CLIENT_ID, POLICY_ID, CLAIM_ID) are mandatory to identify the specific claim to edit, 
> so they are not subject to change. You must provide at least one of the optional fields (-amt, -date -desc) to make an edit.

Format:  
`edit claim -c_id CLIENT_ID -p_id POLICY_ID -cl_id CLAIM_ID [-amt CLAIM_AMOUNT] [-date CLAIM_DATE] [-desc DESCRIPTION]`

Examples:
* To edit **only** the amount of a claim:
    ```
    edit claim -c_id C101 -p_id P101 -cl_id CL001 -amt 1500
    ```
    This updates the amount to $1500 for claim CL001.
* To edit **multiple fields** of a claim:
    ```
    edit claim -c_id C101 -p_id P101 -cl_id CL001 -date 2025-10-05 -desc Emergency surgery
    ```
    This updates the date to 2025-10-05 and its description to "Emergency surgery" for claim CL001.
---

### Locating clients: `find`
<a href=#table-of-contents style="font-size: 0.8em; color: #aaaaaa;">(back to Contents)</a>

Finds clients in InsuraBook by searching for keywords related to their Name or Client ID.

The command's behavior changes depending on the flag you use (`-n` for Name, `-c_id` for Client ID).

---

**Searching by client's name** `-n`:

Searches for clients whose names contain at least one of the specified keywords.

Format: `find -n NAMES [MORE_NAMES]`

Rules:
* **Case-Insensitive**: Keywords are not case-sensitive. (e.g. `alex` will match `Alex`)
* **Full Words Only**: The search matches complete words. (e.g. `Ale` will not match `Alex`)
* **OR Search**: Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned. (e.g. `Alex Yu` will return `Alex Yeoh`,
  `Bernice Yu`)
* **Order Doesn't Matter**: The order of the keywords is not important. (e.g. `Yeoh Alex` will match `Alex Yeoh`)
* If there are no such keywords found, an empty list of clients will be shown.

Examples:
* `find -n John`
  * **Result**: Returns clients named `john` and `John Doe`.
* `find -n alex YU`
  * **Result**: Returns clients named `Alex Yeoh` (who matched `alex`), and `Bernice Yu` (who matched `YU`).

---

Searching by client's ID `-c_id`:

Searches for clients whose CLIENT_IDs match the specified IDs.

Format: `find -c_id CLIENT_IDs [MORE_CLIENT_IDs]`

Rules:
* **OR Search**: You may search for more than one client ID per find command. (e.g. searching for client id `123` `345` will return 2
clients: client A with client ID `123` and client B with client ID `345`)
* **Case-Insensitive**: Client IDs are alphanumerical and the search is not case-sensitive. (e.g., c012 will match C012).
* **Full IDs Only**: The search matches complete IDs. (e.g. `101` will not match `C101`)
* If there are no such IDs found, an empty list of clients will be shown.

Examples:
* `find -c_id c101`
  * **Result**: Returns client with client ID `C101`.
* `find -c_id C102 c103`
  * **Result**: Returns clients with client IDs `C102` and `C103`.

### Deleting a client: `delete`
<a href=#table-of-contents style="font-size: 0.8em; color: #aaaaaa;">(back to Contents)</a>

InsuraBook, use this command.

Format: `delete -c_id CLIENT_ID`

<span style="color:red">‚ö† Action is **irreversible.**</span>

Examples:
* `delete -c_id 123` deletes the client from InsuraBook with client ID `123`.

<p align="center">
    <img alt="img.png" height="300" src="images/deleteClient.png" width="500"/>
</p>

* `delete -c_id C01` deletes the client from InsuraBook with client ID `C01`.

---

### Deleting a policy type: `delete policy type`
<a href=#table-of-contents style="font-size: 0.8em; color: #aaaaaa;">(back to Contents)</a>

Deletes a policy type from InsuraBook. To remove a policy type (product) from your catalog, use this command.

Format:
`delete policy type -pt_n POLICY_TYPE_NAME -pt_id POLICY_TYPE_ID`

<span style="color:red">‚ö† Action is **irreversible.**</span>

Example:
* `delete policy type -pt_n BRUHealth -pt_id BRH001`

<p align="center">
    <img alt="img.png" height="300" src="images/deletePolicyType.png" width="500"/>
</p>

---

### Deleting a policy from a client: `delete policy`
<a href=#table-of-contents style="font-size: 0.8em; color: #aaaaaa;">(back to Contents)</a>

Deletes the specified policy previously saved under a client.

Format:
`delete policy -c_id CLIENT_ID -p_id POLICY_ID`

<span style="color:red">‚ö† Action is **irreversible.**</span>

Example:
* `view -c_id 1` to look for client with client id `1` and all the policies the client owns, followed by
`delete -c_id 1 -p_id 002` deletes policy with policy id 002 from the client's portfolio.

<p align="center">
    <img alt="img.png" height="300" src="images/deletePolicyFromClient.png" width="500"/>
</p>

---

### Deleting a claim: `delete claim`
<a href=#table-of-contents style="font-size: 0.8em; color: #aaaaaa;">(back to Contents)</a>

Deletes the specified claim of a client's policy from the InsuraBook.

Format:
`delete claim -c_id CLIENT_ID -p_id POLICY_ID -cl_id CLAIM_ID [-desc DESCRIPTION]`

> üí° **Tip:** Description is an optional field. It is just for your reference and will not be used to identify the claim to delete.

Example: Let's say you need to delete claim `CL003` from policy `P101` for client `C101`.
1. **First, find the correct IDs:**
    Use `view` command to see all policies and claims for client `C101`.
    ```
    view -c_id C101
    ```
    This command will list all policies and their claims for client `C101`, allowing you to confirm that `P101` and `CL003` are the correct IDs.
2. **Then, execute the delete command:**
    Once you've confirmed the IDs, use the following command to delete the claim:
    ```
    delete claim -c_id C101 -p_id P101 -cl_id CL003
    ```
    This command will delete claim `CL003` from policy `P101` for client `C101`.

---

### Changing UI View: `view`
<a href=#table-of-contents style="font-size: 0.8em; color: #aaaaaa;">(back to Contents)</a>

Changes the view of the user interface. You may switch between 1 of 3 views. The view command lets you switch the main
window's display to show either all clients, all policy types, or all policies for a single client

Format:
`view FLAG [CLIENT_ID]`
* Shows a list of all existing records inside InsuraBook.
* FLAG is used to tell the program what view to choose.
* The default view of the UI will be the client view.
* CLIENT_ID is only used when retrieving the view to display all policies a certain client has bought.

Examples:
* `view -client` changes the view to list out all clients recorded in InsuraBook.

<p align="center">
    <img alt="img.png" height="300" src="images/clientView.png" width="500"/>
</p>

* `view -policy` changes the view to list out all policy types available that are sold or offered by the company.

<p align="center">
    <img alt="img.png" height="300" src="images/policyView.png" width="500"/>
</p>

* `view -c_id 123` changes the view to list out all policies bought by client with clident ID `1`.

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?
**A**: Install the app on the other computer and overwrite its data file with the one from your InsuraBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **Multiple screens:** Moving the app to a secondary screen and later using only one may cause the GUI to open
off-screen.
   **Fix:** Delete `preferences.json` before running again.

2. **Help window minimized:** If minimized, subsequent `help` commands will not open a new window.
   **Fix:** Restore the minimized window manually.

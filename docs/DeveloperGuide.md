### Architecture

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />
</p>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F15b-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/insurabook/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F15b-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/insurabook/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete -c_id C101`.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />
</p>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />
</p>

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F15b-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/insurabook/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter`, `HelpWindow`, `PolicyListPanel`, `PolicyTypeListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`,
inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the
visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the
[`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F15b-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/insurabook/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F15b-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Client` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F15b-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/insurabook/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>
</p>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking
`execute("delete -c_id C101")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for
`DeleteClientCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `InsuraBookParser` object which in turn creates
2. a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteClientCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteClientCommand`)
2. which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a client).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>
</p>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `InsuraBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddClientCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to
parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddClientCommand`) which the `InsuraBookParser`
returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddClientCommandParser`, `DeleteClientCommandParser`, ...) inherit from
the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F15b-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/insurabook/model/Model.java)

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />
</p>

The `Model` component,

* stores the insurabook data i.e., all `Client` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueClientList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Client` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list
which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Client>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be
bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a
`ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F15b-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/insurabook/storage/Storage.java)

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />
</p>

The `Storage` component,
* can save both insurabook data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `InsuraBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `insurabook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Storage Component

#### Purpose and Overview
The Storage component is responsible for all read/write operations on the user's hard drive. It handles the storage of
both the InsuraBook data and user preferences in JSON format. The component ensures that data is correctly serialized 
and deserialized when saving to or loading from disk between application sessions.

All data is stored in a single JSON file named, typically located at `data/insurabook.json` within the home directory.

#### Architecture Design
Our `Model` classes (like `Client`, `Policy`, etc.) are too complex and designed to be independent of the storage
format, which are not suitable for direct JSON serialization.

To solve this, we introduce a parallel set of simple "adapter" classes (e.g., `JsonAdaptedClient`, `JsonAdaptedPolicy`,
etc.). These classes act as intermediaries between the `Model` classes and the JSON format.

**Key Classes:**
* `Storage`: An interface that defines the high-level methods `readInsurabook()` and `saveInsurabook()`. The rest of
the application (e.g., `LogicManager`) only depends on this interface.

* `StorageManager`: The main concrete implementation of `Storage`. It delegates its tasks to `JsonInsurabookStorage`.

* `JsonInsurabookStorage`: This class directly handles the serialization/deserialization of data to and from the JSON
file. It uses the Jackson JSON library.

* `JsonSerializableInsurabook`: A helper class that represents the top-level JSON object (e.g., containing a
`List<JsonAdaptedClient>`).

* `JsonAdaptedClient`: `Client`'s adapter class. It has simple `String` and `List` fields (like `name`, `c_id`,
`policies`). It is responsible for converting a `Client` object to a JSON-friendly format and vice versa.

* `JsonAdaptedPolicyType`: `PolicyType`'s adapter class for the `PolicyType` object.

* `JsonAdaptedPolicy`: `Policy`'s adapter class for the `Policy` object.

* `JsonAdaptedClaim`: `Claim`'s adapter class for the `Claim` object.

#### Data Flow
1. **Saving Data:**
   - This sequence is triggered every time a command that modifies data (like `AddCommand`, `DeleteCommand`, etc.) is
   successfully executed.
    <img src="images/StorageSavingDataSequenceDiagram.png" width="600" />
2. **Loading Data:**
   - This sequence occurs during application startup when the InsuraBook data is loaded from disk.
    <img src="images/StorageLoadingDataSequenceDiagram.png" width="600" />

#### Handling Data Corruption
It is possible that the JSON file on disk may become corrupted or contain invalid data. If the JSON file is malformed,
Jackson will throw a `JsonParseException` during deserialization. If the JSON structure is valid but fails our
internal data validation (e.g., missing required fields, invalid values), we throw an `IllegalValueException`.

To handle this, the `StorageManager` catches these exceptions and wraps them in a `DataLoadingException`, which is then
1. Log the error details for debugging purposes.
2. Move the corrupted file to a backup location (e.g., `data/insurabook_backup_TIMESTAMP.json`) to prevent further issues.
3. Initialize a new empty InsuraBook data file to allow the application to continue functioning.

**Result:** The user sees a warning, and the application starts with a clean slate, as if it's the first launch.
Their corrupted data is not lost, but saved in the backup file for manual inspection.

#### Design Considerations
**Aspect: How to map in-memory Model objects into JSON file?**
Converting complex Model objects directly to JSON can be challenging due to their intricate relationships and data
types, which may not be directly serializable.

**Alternative 1 (current choice): Use adapter classes**
* **Description:** This approach involves creating a set of "adapter" classes (e.g., `JsonAdaptedClient`,
`JsonAdaptedPolicy`) that are simple POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects). The `StorageManager` is responsible for converting
the complex `Model` objects, which contain JavaFX properties, into these simple adapter objects before serialization.
Conversely, it converts the adapter objects back into `Model` objects (running validation) after deserialization.
* **Pros:**
  * **Strong Decoupling:** Decouples the storage format from the Model classes (e.g. `Client`, `Policy`), so they can
  freely use complex JavaFX properties without breaking serialization, allowing both to evolve independently.
  * **Centralized Validation:** Provides a clear and robust location for data validation. The `toModelType()` method in
  each adapter class is the perfect place to check for invalid data (e.g., missing IDs, invalid date formats) before
  the real model objects are created.
  * **Resilience to Changes:** If the Model classes change (e.g., adding new fields), we only need to update the adapter
  classes and the conversion logic in `StorageManager`, rather than modifying the Model classes themselves.
* **Cons:**
  * **Increased Complexity:** Introduces additional classes and conversion logic, which adds some complexity  to the
  codebase and adds one more layer of abstraction.

**Alternative 2: Direct Serialization**
* **Description:** This approach would involve making the `Model` classes (e.g., `Client`, `Policy`) directly
serializable to JSON by adding Jackson annotations or implementing custom serializers/deserializers.
* **Pros:**
  * **Simplicity:** Fewer classes to manage, as there are no adapter classes. The serialization logic is contained
  within the Model classes themselves.
* **Cons:**
* **Tight Coupling:** Couples the `Model` classes to the storage format. The `Model` classes would need to be aware of
serialization concerns, which can clutter their design, making it harder to change one without affecting the other.
* **Limited Flexibility:** Complex `Model` classes with JavaFX properties may not serialize cleanly, leading to
potential data loss or corruption.
* **Scattered Validation:** Data validation logic would be scattered across multiple Model classes, making it harder
to maintain and ensure consistency.

We chose **Alternative 1** because the benefits of decoupling and robust validation are critical for this application.
The `Model` must remain independent of storage to allow flexibility. While Alternative 1 requires more setup, it makes
the entire application safer, more maintainable, and less prone to errors from corrupted data or future refactoring.
